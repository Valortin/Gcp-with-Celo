# Celo Node on Google Cloud Platform

This project demonstrates how to set up a Celo node on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) virtual machine (VM).

## Steps

1. Create a VM instance in GCP.
2. Configure firewall rules for the VM.
3. SSH into the VM and update the system.
4. Install necessary packages.
5. Install Celo CLI and initialize a Celo node.
6. Synchronize the node with the Celo network.
7. Run the Celo node.

For detailed steps, refer to the tutorial.

In this case, since we are deploying a Celo node directly onto a Google Cloud Platform virtual machine (VM) and not creating a custom application, there isn't a specific folder structure or additional code files associated with the setup. The interaction is done primarily through the GCP console for the creation and configuration of the VM, and the command-line interface (CLI) of the VM for updating and installing the necessary software and packages.

To further explain, once the VM is set up, the commands executed within the VM's terminal are dealing with the environment of the VM and not a specific application codebase. The installation and running of the Celo node are handled through the celocli commands and do not require a specific file structure within the VM.

There is no source code to maintain here as all the operations are done with command-line instructions on the terminal of the Google Cloud VM. The tutorial consists of instructions on setting up the environment rather than building an application.
